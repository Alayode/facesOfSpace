Create a character voting app using React, Node.js, MongoDB and Socket.IO
In this tutorial we are going to build a character voting app (inspired by Facemash) for EVE Online - a massively multiplayer online game. You will learn how to build a REST API with Node.js, save and retrieve data from MongoDB, track online visitors in real-time using Socket.IO, build a single-page app experience using React + Flux with server-side rendering and then finally deploy it to the cloud.


Based off of the super rockstar developer Sahat Yalkabov I have followed his tutorial and gathered a deeper knowledge about
React, NodeJS , MongoDB and Socket.IO

to get started start with the following :


````
npm install
node server.js


````

After you CLONED the repo you should be able to to this in the command line.


Cheers!
